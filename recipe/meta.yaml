  summary: A strict, minimal implementation of the Python array API standard.
  description: |
    array_api_strict is a strict, minimal implementation of the Python array API.
    The purpose of array-api-strict is to provide an implementation of the array API 
    for consuming libraries to test against so they can be completely sure their usage 
    of the array API is portable.
    It is not intended to be used by end-users. End-users of the array API should just 
    use their favorite array library (NumPy, CuPy, PyTorch, etc.) as usual. 
    It is also not intended to be used as a dependency by consuming libraries. 
    Consuming library code should use the array-api-compat package to support the array API. 
    Rather, it is intended to be used in the test suites of consuming libraries to test their array API usage.
